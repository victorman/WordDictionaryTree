# WordDictionaryTree
A demonstration of word auto-completion. Type a word in the TextField. Possible complete words will be listed below. Clicking one will replace the text with that word.

Though I'm probably through with this for now, I'd like to implement the following changes some day:
- Show an open TextArea and as you type space delineated words the list of possibilities is shown underneath.
- This may require a complete overhaul of the data structure: prioritize complete words by popularity.
- implement settings boolean values to allow for things like: not returning the current word with possible completes.
